## Story
I have always been fascinated with how immersive our games/apps/experiences can become. One VR experience in particular really caught my attention. It is called Richieâ€™s Plank Experience and was one of the first times I have ever tried VR. The point of the game is to walk a plank high above the city streets. There is no way to explain how absolutely terrifying it was walking out on that plank for the first time. I was convinced that if i fell off that plank, i was done. I felt there was more to be done with this concept which inspired me to create a similar experience called Drop In. This game puts you in a situation that maybe some have experienced but not to this extreme. You are a skateboarder standing on top of a ramp with only one way down. Drop In makes you feel a plethora of emotions, whether it be fear of heights, excitement or danger.
